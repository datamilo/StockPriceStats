## Hypothesis & Conclusion

**Question:** Do shorter-term support levels (1-month, 3-month) work just as well as longer-term ones (1-year) for identifying reliable strike prices when writing put options?

**Conclusion:** ‚úÖ **YES** - Shorter-term rolling lows are actually SUPERIOR because they provide equal success rates (89-90%) with 6-7x more trading opportunities.

## Understanding the Analysis

### Key Concepts

**1. Rolling Support Levels**
- For EVERY trading day, we calculate the lowest price over the past N days (30/90/180/270/365)
- Each day produces a new support level
- This creates a rolling stream of support observations (not rare events!)

**2. Wait Times After Support**
- Once a support level is identified on a trading day, we can wait N days (0/30/60/90/120/180) before writing the put
- Wait times are constrained by the period: 1-month lows can't be waited more than 30 days
- During the wait period, we verify the support hasn't already been broken

**3. Option Testing**
- After the wait period, we write a put option with M days to expiry (7/14/21/30/45)
- Success = Price stays ABOVE the support during the entire option period
- Success = Option expires worthless, we keep the premium

**4. Time Window Constraints**
- 1-month low: wait times can be [0, 30] days only
- 3-month low: wait times can be [0, 30, 60, 90] days only
- 6-month low: wait times can be [0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180] days
- 9-month low: wait times can be [0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180] days
- 1-year low: wait times can be [0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180] days

## Methodology

1. **Calculate Rolling Lows:** For each period and each trading day, find the lowest price in that period
2. **Identify Support Date:** Each trading day produces a support level
3. **Verify Wait Period:** Check that support hasn't been broken during the wait time
4. **Test Option Period:** Check if price stayed above support for the full option duration
5. **Record Success:** Support held = Put expired worthless

**Displays:**
1. **Price Chart** (Interactive Plotly)
   - Daily candlesticks showing open/high/low/close
   - Blue dashed line = rolling low support level
   - Red dots = dates when support broke (new lower low identified)

2. **Key Metrics**
   - Data points in date range
   - Latest closing price (kr)
   - Period low (kr)

3. **Support Level Performance Statistics**
   - Total support levels tested
   - Success rate % (with breakdown: ‚úì successes / ‚úó failures)
   - Average days until support breaks
   - Rolling low changes frequency
   - Detailed breakdown of successful vs failed supports

4. **Price Data Table** (Bottom)

### üèÜ Tab 2: Top Performers Analysis
**Comprehensive metrics across all 68 stocks with 5 sub-tabs**

**Master Control:**
- **Period Selector:** Choose 1-Month, 3-Month, 6-Month, 9-Month, or 1-Year to analyze

Each metric is calculated across all 68 stocks and displayed in the same time period.

#### **Sub-Tab 1: üìà Success Metrics**

## Dataset

- **Stocks:** 68 Nordic blue-chip stocks with liquid options markets
- **Date Range:** 2000-2025 (25 years)
- **Total Records:** 359K price records (filtered for options-enabled stocks)
- **Source:** `../../price_data_filtered.parquet`

## Example: How the Analysis Works

**Scenario:** Stock at 150 kr in January

1. **January 10:** 1-month rolling low = 150 kr (lowest price in past 30 days)
2. **Wait 30 days** ‚Üí February 9 (price stays above 150 kr during the wait)
3. **February 9:** Write 30-day put with strike at 150 kr
4. **March 11:** Check if price stayed ‚â• 150 kr the entire option period
   - If YES: ‚úì Success (option expired worthless, premium kept)
   - If NO: ‚úó Failure (price went below 150 kr, assignment risk)

The analysis tested this exact scenario across:
- **68 stocks** (Nordic options universe)
- **25 years** of historical data (2000-2025)
- **All 5 rolling periods** (1, 3, 6, 9, 12 months)
- **All wait times** (0-180 days, constrained by period)
- **All option expiries** (7-45 days)
- **Total:** ~30 million historical test cases

## What the Results Show

Success rates show the historical probability that a put option would expire worthless:

| Period | Success Rate | Opportunities |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| 1-Month | 89.7% | Highest (daily) |
| 3-Month | 89.0% | Very high (6-7x vs 1-year) |
| 6-Month | ~88% | Moderate |
| 9-Month | ~88% | Moderate |
| 1-Year | 87.8% | Lowest |

**Key Insight:** Shorter periods give equal or better success rates with far more trading opportunities.
