## Project Purpose

This project analyzes stock price data to determine optimal put option writing strategies. The goal is to collect premium by writing put options while minimizing the risk of assignment.

## Strategy Overview

**Put Option Writing for Premium Collection:**
- Write (sell) put options on selected stocks
- Collect premium upfront
- Objective: Options expire worthless (never get assigned)
- Focus: Identifying optimal strike prices that maximize premium while minimizing assignment risk

## Dataset

**Scope:**
- **All Data:** 675K records, 2,099 stocks (2000-2025)
- **Filtered Data:** 367K records, 70 Nordic stocks with liquid options markets
- **Geographic Focus:** Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, and Finnish blue-chip stocks

**Data Files:**
- `price_data_all.parquet` - Complete historical data
- `price_data_filtered.parquet` - Filtered data (options-enabled stocks only)
- `nasdaq_options_available.csv` - List of 70 stocks with available options

**Filtering Rationale:** Only stocks with liquid options markets can be used for this strategy, reducing the universe to 70 actionable candidates.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Time Estimates

**CRITICAL RULE: NEVER give time estimates unless you are 100% certain they are correct.**

- ‚ùå **WRONG:** "This will take about 30 minutes", "Should be done in an hour", "Approximately 15 minutes"
- ‚úÖ **CORRECT:** "The analysis is currently running. Check progress by looking at file timestamps or process status"

**Why:**
- Complex tasks depend on too many variables (data size, CPU cores, I/O, memory contention, system load)
- Estimates are almost always wrong
- False time estimates create false expectations and frustration
- It's better to provide NO estimate than an incorrect one

**Instead of estimates:**
- Check actual progress indicators (process CPU/memory, file modification times, console output)
- Report what you observe: "70/70 stocks processed for 1-Month LOW, currently processing 6-Month LOW"
- Invite the user to check back when they want updates: "Check in whenever you like for progress updates"
- Never use words like "should", "should take", "approximately", "about", "estimated"

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Currency Convention

**This is a Swedish market analysis. ALL currency references MUST use Swedish Krona (kr), NEVER USD ($).**

- ‚úÖ **Correct:** "50 kr", "100 kr", "price of 250 kr"
- ‚ùå **Wrong:** "$50", "$100", "price of $250", "SEK"

**Rules:**
- Use "kr" for Swedish Krona (not "SEK")
- Never use "$" or "USD" in any documentation, examples, code comments, or dashboards
- All price examples should reflect realistic Swedish stock prices (typically 50-500 kr range)
- When creating examples or documentation, always use "kr" as the currency symbol

## Hypotheses Testing Framework

This project uses a **structured hypothesis testing approach** to systematically evaluate put option writing strategies.

### Directory Structure

**Location:** `hypotheses/`

**Naming Convention:** `h{NNN}_{short_description}/`
- `NNN` = 3-digit hypothesis number (001, 002, 003, ...)
- `short_description` = Brief snake_case name

### Standard Files in Each Hypothesis

Every hypothesis folder contains:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `README.md` | Quick reference, overview, and navigation |
| `METHODOLOGY_AND_FINDINGS.md` | Comprehensive detailed analysis |
| `*dashboard.html` | Interactive visualization dashboard (recommended starting point) |
| `*.py` | Analysis scripts |
| `*.csv` | Results data |
| `*.png` | Static visualization charts |

**Dashboard Features (H001 example):**
- Self-contained with comprehensive explanations
- Interactive charts with date range sliders
- Visual event markers
- All examples use kr (Swedish Krona)

## Active Hypotheses

### H001: Multi-Period Low Support Analysis

**Location:** `hypotheses/h001_multi_period_low_support/`

**Question:** Do we need to wait for a full 1-year low, or are shorter-term lows (1, 3, 6, 9 months) just as reliable for put option writing?

**Result:** ‚úÖ **VALIDATED** - 1-month and 3-month lows work just as well as 1-year lows, with 6-7x more opportunities!

**Key Findings:**
- **1-Month Lows:** 89.7% success rate (90d age ‚Üí next 30d) with 2,488 proven supports
- **3-Month Lows:** 89.0% success rate (90d age ‚Üí next 30d) with 1,195 proven supports
- **1-Year Lows:** 87.8% success rate (90d age ‚Üí next 30d) with only 372 proven supports
- **Game Changer:** Shorter-term lows provide 6-7x more trading opportunities with equal or better success rates
- **Key Insight:** Support age matters MORE than the low period itself

**üìä View Results:**
- **Interactive Dashboard:** `hypotheses/h001_multi_period_low_support/multi_period_dashboard.html` ‚≠ê **START HERE**
  - Self-contained with all explanations included
  - Interactive price charts with date range sliders
  - Visual support event markers (blue/green/red)
  - Period comparison tables and charts
  - All examples use kr (Swedish Krona)
- **Quick Reference:** `hypotheses/h001_multi_period_low_support/README.md`
- **Detailed Analysis:** `hypotheses/h001_multi_period_low_support/METHODOLOGY_AND_FINDINGS.md`

**Analysis Details:**
- 70 stocks analyzed
- 5,217 proven support events across all low periods
- 25-year historical period (2000-2025)
- 5 low periods tested: 1-month, 3-month, 6-month, 9-month, 1-year
- 5 age checkpoints: 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 days
- 5 test periods: 7, 14, 21, 30, 45 days

## Future Hypotheses (Planned)

### H002: Multi-Year Lows
- Test 2-year and 3-year lows as support levels
- Hypothesis: Longer-term lows may be more significant

### H003: Volume-Confirmed Supports
- Require low volume during support testing period
- Hypothesis: Low volume = less selling pressure = stronger support

### H004: Trend Context Analysis
- Separate uptrend vs downtrend support levels
- Hypothesis: Uptrend lows are more reliable

### H005: Volatility Regime Analysis
- High IV vs Low IV environment comparison
- Hypothesis: Support reliability varies by volatility regime

## Documentation Philosophy

**This CLAUDE.md file:**
- ‚úÖ Provides high-level project overview
- ‚úÖ Acts as an index to detailed documentation
- ‚úÖ Lists active hypotheses with quick summaries
- ‚úÖ Shows project structure
- ‚ùå Does NOT contain detailed methodologies
- ‚ùå Does NOT contain full results
- ‚ùå Does NOT contain comprehensive findings

**For detailed information:**
- Navigate to the specific hypothesis folder
- Start with the interactive `dashboard.html` (if available)
- Read `README.md` for quick reference
- Consult `METHODOLOGY_AND_FINDINGS.md` for comprehensive analysis

**Goal:** Keep this file clean, scannable, and easy to navigate while maintaining comprehensive documentation in appropriate subdirectories.
